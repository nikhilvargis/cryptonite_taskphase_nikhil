# Percieving Permissions

## Changing File Ownership
We can change ownership of a file using chown. Here we change owner to hacker and read /flag.


### flag:
```pwn.college{g9Ot0_WTVFMwubRUpY0jL-zQIGB.dFTM2QDL4QTN0czW}```

## Groups and Files
Groups can have access to files and we can use chgrp to change the group that has access and hence we obtain the flag.

### flag:
```pwn.college{0uwRJjHAKydBbDr80eGXyqjSeZ0.dFzNyUDL4QTN0czW}```

## Fun with Group Names
We combine what we learned in the previous 2 challenges.

### flag:
```pwn.college{kYQs2H9PMb_6gBLMC7NG1Cdd8tD.dJzNyUDL4QTN0czW}```
